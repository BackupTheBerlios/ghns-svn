The "Get Hot New Stuff" concept allows users to share their
creations with other users. Information about GHNS can be
found at http://ghns.freedesktop.org/.

The jGHNS library implements this concept in Java. Run 'make'
to build the library and a little test programme.

This requires jikes and kaffe to be installed.
