<h1>"Get Hot New Stuff" (GHNS) resource site</h1>

<p>
The GHNS standard is now maintained at
<a href="http://ghns.freedesktop.org/">http://ghns.freedesktop.org/</a>.
</p>

<p>
On this page, related software which doesn't find a home elsewhere can be hosted.
For the time being, the only software available is jGHNS, a not yet functional
Java library to access content from GHNS, and DXS Client, a small perl tool to access
the DXS on the command line along with a sample webservice.
