<h1>Get Hot New Stuff for Java: jGHNS</h1>

<p>
The jGHNS library provides access to
<a href="http://ghns.freedesktop.org/">Get Hot New Stuff</a> resources on
remote servers. Beside the data abstraction library, a small download
dialog for AWT is available as well.
Note that a requirement for the development of jGHNS is that it works on
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/news/free-java-and-flash.html">Free Java</a>
platforms.
</p>

<p>
Status: Very premature. It might not even get finished unless someone
shows some interest in it. You might want to have a look at the
<a href="jghns.png">screenshot</a>.
</p>

<p>
Downloads: jGHNS is licenced under the GNU GPL. You need jikes and kaffe
to use it, and the Xerces XML parser library.
Also, make (and not ant) is used to build it, although a contributed ant
file would be nice to have.

Development happens in the Subversion repository, module jghns. See the
