<h1>DXS client (and test webservice)</h1>

<p>
This is a first implementation of both a DXS server (note: it's only a dummy
server for now) and a command line client for it. With the client, it is
possible to upload data and to get provider information.
</p>

<p>
TODO: A WSDL documentation tool is needed. Also, a DXS web interface should be
created which communicates over SOAP. Beside SOAP, a REST implementation might
be useful to have as well.
</p>

Downloads: DXS-Perl is licenced under the GNU GPL.
Download the sources, uncompress them and follow the README. You'll
likely need to install some Perl modules as dependencies.
